        <h1>About Claire</h1>
        <p>
            Claire is an amazing person.
            <br>She is really nerdy, kind, thoughtful, detailist and romantic (lowkey corny).
            <br>She takes care of others, often even putting others above herself.
            <br>She is absolutely gorgeous, and has a great fashion sense.
            <br>Everytime I talk to her she always finds the way to make me laugh, and make my days happier.
            <br>Her favorite flowers are tulips, specially if they're pink, and her favorite color is purple.
            <br>For some unknown reason she decided to be allergic to some seafood and lactose intolerant (writing this down for when I take you for dinner)
            <br>She LOVES animals, and she likes taking care of the environment.
            <br>Her dad inspired her to be an engineer, and I'm sure she will be really good at it.
            <br>She enjoys listening to music, reading books, watching cheesy movies and gossiping.
            <br>She likes traveling and getting to know new cultures, and she is proud of her mexican roots.
            <br>She is a yapper, but listening to her has become the highlight of my days.
            <br>I've never met anyone like her before, and I could not be more grateful for it.
            <br>Thanks for being you, and thanks for illuminating the life of those around you.
